    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class=”oneandhalf”>For the past 9 months I have been a student at Epicodus where I have learned how to create web applications in various languages including Javascript, C#, 
        Angular and .NET. It's been exciting to not only learn to code in these languages but to pair program every day with a new partner as well as work on larger team projects to achieve more ambitious goals. 
        I was amazed at how much I had learned and retained each week. In addition to coding I am learning how to learn and think like a programmer and where and how to 
        search to find answers.

        As a new Web Developer I bring a history as a professional audio production specialist with 10+ years experience in recording, composition, mixing and mastering to the table. I have written and produced music for major clients around the globe such as the BBC, MTV and Samsung.
        Most recently I have been a freelance composer and content provider for Big Idea Music, a Seattle based production music library. In this role I compose and produce albums of music in various contemporary styles for placement in advertisements, television shows, web content, corporate video and film. Recent placements include advertisements for the Samsung Galaxy S6, Hyundai, Seattle Mariners, and MTV’s “Are You The One”.
        Colleagues know me as being well organized, reliable and creative in both my work and my problem solving. I can (and often do) work on projects alone but I am equally at home when working with or leading a team. In the sometimes challenging and subjective field of music production, I have the communication skills and patience required to ascertain what the client’s needs are and to exceed their expectations.
        I earned a certificate in audio production from the University of Washington.
